I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I am a member of the Cryptography, Security and Privacy (CrySP) lab and am supervised by Florian Kerschbaum. My current research is security and privacy in data management and machine learning. I am in particular working on protecting the privacy of individuals in databases by using differential privacy techniques. 

Prior to starting my PhD at University of Waterloo, through years of experinece in research institutes and industry, I worked on a variety of topics in privacy and cryptography. As research assistant at University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, I proposed a post-quantum (hash-based) group signature scheme. As manager of cryptography lab in Research Center of Informatic Industries (RCII), in Tehran, Iran, I evaluated implementations of cryptographic algorithms embedded in public key infrastructure products. I also conducted studies to establish a side-channel analysis lab in RCII. 

I received my MSc and BSc degrees from Sharif University of Technology and Shahid Beheshti University respectively in Tehran, Iran. In my masters thesis, I proposed a combinatorial key predistribution scheme for rireless sensor networks with group deployment of nodes. In my undergraduate thesis, I evaluated the success of feature extraction by using princial compnent analysis in detecting the gender of face images. 

I am currently looking for internship positions to apply my knowledge and experties in security and privacy to solve the real world problems.
